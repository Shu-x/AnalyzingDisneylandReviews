If you come to Tokyo you simply cannot miss Disney. The wait times were not long at all and even though there were lots of people there, lines flowed seemlessly. Had lots of yummy treats like turkey legs, different flavoured popcorns - curry, strawberry cheesecake and Mickey shaped ice cream sandwiches or ice blocks. Went on all the rides with ease, most we went on 2 x. Spent 10 hrs there and it just went so fast. It was a humid day but Disney had the lines flowing so you weren’t in the sun long and water stations were everywhere. We used the 40 yr Premium Pass for 4 rides and we were able to book them and use them getting notifications on the app when the time was close. The best day.

Instead I concentrated my time on rides that aren't available in my neck of the woods. We arrived to the park at noon because we were had spent the morning in Tokyo exchanging JR vouchers and reacclimating to the new timezone. We also had to drop off our luggage at our hotel before heading to the parks. We had our Disney park tickets prepurchased on Klook so we were set to go. We jumped on the shuttle from our hotel and was dropped off at the train station and made our way to the park from Maihama.We purchased the Premier Access Pass for the Beauty and the Beast Ride as soon as we entered the gates via the Tokyo Disneyland app, which to me is the BEST ride in this park, hands down. It's fully immersive and just wonderful in the storytelling to the animatronics but in Japanese. If you're a fan of Beauty and the Beast, this is the ride to end all rides. Not only did Tokyo Disneyland recreate Belle's French village, they constructed the Beast's castle for the ride. The mother-effing castle is is here in the park in addition to Cinderella's castle. You walk through the beginning of the tale and then you enter a tea cup and ride a trackless ride around the castle, as a guest. If you've been on Rise of the Resistance, then you know what fully immersive means when it comes to a ride. We saw full grown adults with tears coming off of this ride. It's that good.While Tokyo Disneyland feels smaller somehow, it has massive amounts of land so everything is spaced out. Pick and choose your rides. We went on Space Mountain, Monster's Inc, Star Tours, Beauty and the Beast, It's a Small World, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Cinderella's Fairytale Castle walk-through, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain (the only one left since DL and WDW is retheming theirs). To be able to visit another Disney park is literally a dream come true and the admission cost is way more cost-effective in Japan than in the US. That's currently a FACT. We spent about $60ish USD per person per park in Japan, so do the math. Of course, you have to pay for airfare, so it might be a wash. The Castmembers at Tokyo Disneyland are so animated and seem genuinely happy to be interacting with guests. It was their 40th Anniversary when we went so it was extra magical with the option of obtaining free fast passes for certain rides. We had a wonderful time even in rainy humidity.</td>\n","      <td>Disneyland_Tokyo</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   Rating Year_Month      Reviewer_Location  \\\n","0       5    2023-09  Johor Bahru, Malaysia   \n","1       5    2023-09       Perth, Australia   \n","2       5    2023-09                    NaN   \n","3       4    2023-09    Attadale, Australia   \n","4       4    2023-09      Orange County, CA   \n","\n","                         Review_Title  \\\n","0  Worth every penny and every minute   \n","1        The BEST day in Tokyo Disney   \n","2                       Lovely place    \n","3              Solo day at Disneyland   \n","4        Happy 40th Tokyo Disneyland!

It was a memorable visit that we will never forget.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Honestly this was a brilliant day at Tokyo Disney. If you come to Tokyo you simply cannot miss Disney. The wait times were not long at all and even though there were lots of people there, lines flowed seemlessly. Had lots of yummy treats like turkey legs, different flavoured popcorns - curry, strawberry cheesecake and Mickey shaped ice cream sandwiches or ice blocks. Went on all the rides with ease, most we went on 2 x. Spent 10 hrs there and it just went so fast. It was a humid day but Disney had the lines flowing so you weren’t in the sun long and water stations were everywhere. We used the 40 yr Premium Pass for 4 rides and we were able to book them and use them getting notifications on the app when the time was close. The best day. Don’t miss Disneyland Tokyo.    \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It is a smaller version of Orlando. Very busy and long lineups due to its popularity.  We watched a special effects film there. It was pretty awesome. Great experience and worth a visit.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Definitely a must see however doesn’t quite top the OG in Anaheim. A lot of the rides are in Japanese but still fantastic fun - the beauty and the beast ride was my favourite. Food wasn’t anything great however all added to the experience, lots of popcorn stands offering different flavours which was quite cool. Brings out your inner child and all the nostalgia :)   \n","4  Being a Magic Key passholder at Disneyland in California, I knew going to Tokyo Disneyland that I wouldn't need to spend too much time on rides I already know and love. Instead I concentrated my time on rides that aren't available in my neck of the woods. We arrived to the park at noon because we were had spent the morning in Tokyo exchanging JR vouchers and reacclimating to the new timezone. We also had to drop off our luggage at our hotel before heading to the parks. We had our Disney park tickets prepurchased on Klook so we were set to go. We jumped on the shuttle from our hotel and was dropped off at the train station and made our way to the park from Maihama.We purchased the Premier Access Pass for the Beauty and the Beast Ride as soon as we entered the gates via the Tokyo Disneyland app, which to me is the BEST ride in this park, hands down. It's fully immersive and just wonderful in the storytelling to the animatronics but in Japanese. If you're a fan of Beauty and the Beast, this is the ride to end all rides. Not only did Tokyo Disneyland recreate Belle's French village, they constructed the Beast's castle for the ride. The mother-effing castle is is here in the park in addition to Cinderella's castle. You walk through the beginning of the tale and then you enter a tea cup and ride a trackless ride around the castle, as a guest. If you've been on Rise of the Resistance, then you know what fully immersive means when it comes to a ride. We saw full grown adults with tears coming off of this ride. It's that good.While Tokyo Disneyland feels smaller somehow, it has massive amounts of land so everything is spaced out. Pick and choose your rides. We went on Space Mountain, Monster's Inc, Star Tours, Beauty and the Beast, It's a Small World, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Cinderella's Fairytale Castle walk-through, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain (the only one left since DL and WDW is retheming theirs). To be able to visit another Disney park is literally a dream come true and the admission cost is way more cost-effective in Japan than in the US. That's currently a FACT. We spent about $60ish USD per person per park in Japan, so do the math. Of course, you have to pay for airfare, so it might be a wash. The Castmembers at Tokyo Disneyland are so animated and seem genuinely happy to be interacting with guests. It was their 40th Anniversary when we went so it was extra magical with the option of obtaining free fast passes for certain rides.

If you come to Tokyo you simply cannot miss Disney. The wait times were not long at all and even though there were lots of people there, lines flowed seemlessly. Had lots of yummy treats like turkey legs, different flavoured popcorns - curry, strawberry cheesecake and Mickey shaped ice cream sandwiches or ice blocks. Went on all the rides with ease, most we went on 2 x. Spent 10 hrs there and it just went so fast. It was a humid day but Disney had the lines flowing so you weren’t in the sun long and water stations were everywhere. We used the 40 yr Premium Pass for 4 rides and we were able to book them and use them getting notifications on the app when the time was close. The best day. Don’t miss Disneyland Tokyo.</td>\n","      <td>Disneyland_Tokyo</td>\n","      <td>2023</td>\n","      <td>9</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>Attadale, Australia</td>\n","      <td>Solo day at Disneyland</td>\n","      <td>Definitely a must see however doesn’t quite top the OG in Anaheim.

Instead I concentrated my time on rides that aren't available in my neck of the woods. We arrived to the park at noon because we were had spent the morning in Tokyo exchanging JR vouchers and reacclimating to the new timezone. We also had to drop off our luggage at our hotel before heading to the parks. We had our Disney park tickets prepurchased on Klook so we were set to go. We jumped on the shuttle from our hotel and was dropped off at the train station and made our way to the park from Maihama.We purchased the Premier Access Pass for the Beauty and the Beast Ride as soon as we entered the gates via the Tokyo Disneyland app, which to me is the BEST ride in this park, hands down. It's fully immersive and just wonderful in the storytelling to the animatronics but in Japanese. If you're a fan of Beauty and the Beast, this is the ride to end all rides. Not only did Tokyo Disneyland recreate Belle's French village, they constructed the Beast's castle for the ride. The mother-effing castle is is here in the park in addition to Cinderella's castle. You walk through the beginning of the tale and then you enter a tea cup and ride a trackless ride around the castle, as a guest. If you've been on Rise of the Resistance, then you know what fully immersive means when it comes to a ride. We saw full grown adults with tears coming off of this ride. It's that good.While Tokyo Disneyland feels smaller somehow, it has massive amounts of land so everything is spaced out. Pick and choose your rides. We went on Space Mountain, Monster's Inc, Star Tours, Beauty and the Beast, It's a Small World, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Cinderella's Fairytale Castle walk-through, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain (the only one left since DL and WDW is retheming theirs). To be able to visit another Disney park is literally a dream come true and the admission cost is way more cost-effective in Japan than in the US. That's currently a FACT. We spent about $60ish USD per person per park in Japan, so do the math. Of course, you have to pay for airfare, so it might be a wash.

It was a memorable visit that we will never forget.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Honestly this was a brilliant day at Tokyo Disney. If you come to Tokyo you simply cannot miss Disney. The wait times were not long at all and even though there were lots of people there, lines flowed seemlessly. Had lots of yummy treats like turkey legs, different flavoured popcorns - curry, strawberry cheesecake and Mickey shaped ice cream sandwiches or ice blocks. Went on all the rides with ease, most we went on 2 x. Spent 10 hrs there and it just went so fast. It was a humid day but Disney had the lines flowing so you weren’t in the sun long and water stations were everywhere. We used the 40 yr Premium Pass for 4 rides and we were able to book them and use them getting notifications on the app when the time was close. The best day. Don’t miss Disneyland Tokyo.    \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Definitely a must see however doesn’t quite top the OG in Anaheim. A lot of the rides are in Japanese but still fantastic fun - the beauty and the beast ride was my favourite. Food wasn’t anything great however all added to the experience, lots of popcorn stands offering different flavours which was quite cool. Brings out your inner child and all the nostalgia :)   \n","4  Being a Magic Key passholder at Disneyland in California, I knew going to Tokyo Disneyland that I wouldn't need to spend too much time on rides I already know and love. Instead I concentrated my time on rides that aren't available in my neck of the woods. We arrived to the park at noon because we were had spent the morning in Tokyo exchanging JR vouchers and reacclimating to the new timezone. We also had to drop off our luggage at our hotel before heading to the parks. We had our Disney park tickets prepurchased on Klook so we were set to go. We jumped on the shuttle from our hotel and was dropped off at the train station and made our way to the park from Maihama.We purchased the Premier Access Pass for the Beauty and the Beast Ride as soon as we entered the gates via the Tokyo Disneyland app, which to me is the BEST ride in this park, hands down. It's fully immersive and just wonderful in the storytelling to the animatronics but in Japanese. If you're a fan of Beauty and the Beast, this is the ride to end all rides. Not only did Tokyo Disneyland recreate Belle's French village, they constructed the Beast's castle for the ride. The mother-effing castle is is here in the park in addition to Cinderella's castle. You walk through the beginning of the tale and then you enter a tea cup and ride a trackless ride around the castle, as a guest. If you've been on Rise of the Resistance, then you know what fully immersive means when it comes to a ride. We saw full grown adults with tears coming off of this ride. It's that good.While Tokyo Disneyland feels smaller somehow, it has massive amounts of land so everything is spaced out. Pick and choose your rides. We went on Space Mountain, Monster's Inc, Star Tours, Beauty and the Beast, It's a Small World, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Cinderella's Fairytale Castle walk-through, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain (the only one left since DL and WDW is retheming theirs). To be able to visit another Disney park is literally a dream come true and the admission cost is way more cost-effective in Japan than in the US. That's currently a FACT. We spent about $60ish USD per person per park in Japan, so do the math. Of course, you have to pay for airfare, so it might be a wash. The Castmembers at Tokyo Disneyland are so animated and seem genuinely happy to be interacting with guests. It was their 40th Anniversary when we went so it was extra magical with the option of obtaining free fast passes for certain rides. We had a wonderful time even in rainy humidity.   \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was fun! But…Stars deducted because I paid 7,500yen for Premier Access seating for the parade. The parade was cancelled due to heat, and the staff was unable provide any details on refunds. No refunds in the App till date, I lost 7,500yen for nothing.Mass diners were crowded with several diners left without tables, and tables occupied by teens for their nap or escape from the heat.Full praises for the Princes/Princesses! There was no queue system to take picture with them, BUT the princes/princesses were highly trained to scan the crowd to know who came first and naturally engaged them.
